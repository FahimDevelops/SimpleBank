# SimpleBank

In my journey to learning how to code, this was my first ever project. It is a simple banking application that uses for loops, while loops, as well as switch cases to function completely. Although I've made other rather more complex programs. I will always be proud of this one the most. Please use Eclipse to run. I am currently working on the front end as well. Perhaps a program that allows kids to understand how banking works
